PK-Rust is a Pokémon save file editor, similar to the [PKHeX project](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX). While it isn't finished, it aims to be fully capable of reading, modifying Generation 1 save files in their entirety, and not just your Pokémon.

PK-Rust will also aim to not allow users to create "illegal" Pokémon.

All Pokémon names, images and data are property of the Pokémon Company, Nintendo and Game Freak.

<!-- ### Progress
Completion percentages are an estimate for now, but I'll tally everything up and maybe put it on a kanban board for better tracking.
